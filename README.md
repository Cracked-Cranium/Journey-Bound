# Journey Bound

## What is Journey Bound?

Journey Bound is a game created by some simple Te4 students at NTI Odenplan.
We had an idea one afternoon of creating a game, there was no plans or dreams that we wanted to fulfill. We just wanted to create a game.
That is where this game came from. A simple idea turned into a project with a goal of releasing it.

This game is just for fun and is not really made to be the best of the best or something extra, but we still wanted to give it more than average! :)

## What you need

We use Raylib as the rendering engine.

## Compiling
We have included build scripts for each platform. (RAYLIB NEEDED!)
### Windows
run the "build.exe" for Windows
### Mac
run the "build.sh" for Mac -- NOTE: If you don't have permission to run the build.sh file, type ``` chmod 777 build.sh ``` in the terminal to change permission level for the build file.
