# Journey Bound

## What is Journey Bound?

Journey Bound is a game created by some simple Te4 students at NTI Odenplan.
We had an idea one afternoon of creating a game, there was no plans or dreams that we wanted to fulfill. We just wanted to create a game.
That is where this game came from. A simple idea turned into a project with a goal of releasing it.

This game is just for fun and is not really made to be the best of the best or something extra, but we still wanted to give it more than average! :)
